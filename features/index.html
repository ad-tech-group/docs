    Data Caching:<br />
    This OpenSSP uses predefined data to enrich the incoming requests and build the various bid requests.<br />
    This data e.g. for websites has to be loaded in an asynchronous manner.<br />
    The data will be loaded via a restful service, usually due to the fact that calling a database in realtime is not feasible.<br />
    Therefore, this SSP loads the data from a web service periodically and stores that data in a memory based key-value store called the cache.
