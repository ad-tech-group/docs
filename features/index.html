	   <h3>Multi channel support</h3>
	  <div>
    		Multi channel support means that not only RTB demand provided by a Demand Side Platform will be considered<br /> in the auction,
		but also demand from an optional Adserver.<br />
		OpenSSP also offers the opportunity to implement adapters to other SSP's,<br />
		sending them requests corresponding to the bidrequest and consider their response to the set of auctionable bids.

	  <h3>Second Price Sealed Bid</h3>
	  <div>
    		OpenSSP mainly supports Second Price Sealed Bid.<br />
		What does that mean? The bidder with the highest bid wins the auction but only has to pay the price of the second best bidder plus 1 cent.

	  <h3>Data Caching</h3>
	  <div>
    		The OpenSSP uses predefined data to enrich the incoming requests and build the various bid requests.<br />
    		This data e.g. for websites has to be loaded in an asynchronous manner.<br />
    		The data will be loaded via a RESTful service, usually due to the fact that calling a database in realtime is not feasible.<br />
    		Therefore, this SSP loads the data from a web service periodically and stores that data in a memory based key-value store called the cache.
