	  <h3>Data Caching</h3>
	  <div>
    		This OpenSSP uses predefined data to enrich the incoming requests and build the various bid requests.<br />
    		This data e.g. for websites has to be loaded in an asynchronous manner.<br />
    		The data will be loaded via a restful service, usually due to the fact that calling a database in realtime is not feasible.<br />
    		Therefore, this SSP loads the data from a web service periodically and stores that data in a memory based key-value store called the cache.
	  </div>
	  
	  <h3>Second Price Sealed Bid</h3>
	  <div>
    		OpenSSP mainly supports Sescond Price Sealed Bid.<br >
		What does it mean? The bidder with the highest bid wins the auction but has just to pay the price of the second best bidder with an amount of 1 cent.
	  </div>
	  
	  <h3>Multi channel support</h3>
	  <div>
    		Multi channel support means that not only RTB demand provides by a Demand Side Platform will be considered in the auction, <br />
		also demand from a optional Adserver can be filles in the set of autionable bids. <br />
		But thats not enough, also adapter to other SSP's can be implemented and considered into the auction.
