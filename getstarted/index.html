		<h1>Get Started</h1>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h3>Local environment</h3>
		 <ol type="1">
			<li>Download the Zip file or clone the project if you would like to contribute to the project.</li>
			<li>2. Import the project into your desired IDE via Maven Import.</li>
			 <li>Build the project from the parent with Maven Goal <code>mvn clean install</code>. <br />A war file will be generated within the target folder of the core project.</li>
			<li>Run OpenSSP from the core project with Maven Goal <code>mvn tomcat7:run-war</code>.</li>
			<li>OpenSSP is now ready to retrieve requests on port 8080 for developing, testing and debugging purposes.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Server setup</h3>
		<div>
			<b>Prerequisites:</b>
		</div>
		<div>
			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li>Required: Install and configure a Servlet Container e.g. Apache Tomcat.</li>
				<li>Required: Set up a properties folder to store the resource files <code>global.runtime.xml</code>, <code>local.runtime.xml</code> and <code>log4j2.xml (optional)</code>.<br/>
					For example, if you choose Apache Tomcat as your Servlet Container, create the properties folder where the CATALINA_HOME is located.</li>
				<li>Recommended: Set up the runtime files <code>global.runtime.xml</code> and <code>local.runtime.xml</code>.<br />
					These files will be read during startup process. A Watchdog observes these files for changes and starts the a load process to store the values. See the runtime files for more information.</li>
				<li>Optional: Set up a log structure for customized logs. Default logging is console logging.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li>Define a request tag and place it within the ad space.<br/>
					The ad space is the placeholder on the publisher's site for a markup which will be served by the SSP.
					The definition of the tag and the parameters depend on your requirements.</li>
				<li>Adjust the <code>com.atg.openssp.core.entry.EntryValidator</code> to read the values and store this data in the SessionAgent.</li>
				<li>You need an external data source in order to enrich the bid request to a demand side with the required data as the OpenRTB protocol prescribes.<br />
					A common way is to setup a service (e.g. RESTful service) which periodically loads the data of publishers, websites etc.
					This data comes from a database and will be stored onto the memory of the SSP (cache).<br />
					Example: Define a request parameter e.g. <code>&publisher=1234</code> with ID of the publisher as it is stored in your database.<br />
					Read the cached data with the key of 1234 and you will retrieve further information about the publisher which you can put into the bid request.</li>

				<li>Of course, you first need a demand partner to send the bid request to. Therefore, it is also recommended to create a service to load that data.
					The RTB DemandService will load the demand partner (also called supplier), send the bid request to them and wait for an answer.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

		<h3>Deployment to Server</h3>
		<div>
			After finishing your setup, you are only a few steps away from succesfully running the system.
		</div>
		<ol type="1">
			<li>Build the project from the parent with Maven Goal <code>mvn clean install</code>.</li>
			<li>Deploy the war file into the webapps folder.</li>
			<li>Run the Servlet Container.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<div>
		And finally send request to your SSP.
	</div>
